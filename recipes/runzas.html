        <!---Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>⅔ cup instant dry milk powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <!---Steps-->
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef and onion until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in cabbage and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Continue to cook and stir until cabbage is tender, about 20 more minutes. Set mixture aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Mix warm water and butter in a large bowl. Combine dry milk powder, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and yeast in another bowl; stir into butter mixture. Add egg and gradually stir in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough is smooth.</li>
            <li>Roll dough out to 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface; cut into 4-inch squares. Scoop beef mixture into each dough square. Bring corners of a dough square together at the top and pinch corners together to seal. Place on a baking sheet, seam side down. Repeat with remaining beef mixture and dough. Cover rolls with a damp cloth and allow to rise for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
