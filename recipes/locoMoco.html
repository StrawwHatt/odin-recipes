        <!--Loco Moco: Description-->
        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This amazing Hawaiian comfort food classic is made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, brown gravy and finished with a fried egg.</p>
        <p>Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution. Garnish with green onions.</p>

        <!---Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) patties ground beef
            </li>
            <li>½ pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
            </li>
            <li>½ pinch cayenne pepper
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>For the Gravy:</strong>
        
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup beef stock</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 drops sesame oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced green onions, white and light green parts only</li>
            <li>1 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
        </ul>

        <!---Steps-->
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Whisk beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, ketchup, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty in the hot skillet until a browned crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip; toss in green onions and cook the other side until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patty and most of the green onions to a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.</li>
            <li>Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over the rice, spoon gravy on top, and add the fried eggs.</li>
        </ol>
